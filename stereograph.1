.SH NAME
stereograph \- stereogram generator


.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fBstereograph\fP [\fIoptions\fP] -b \fIbase\fP [-t \fItexture\fP] [-o \fIoutput\fP]


.SH DESCRIPTION

Stereograph is a stereogram generator. In detail it is a single image
stereogram (SIS) generator. It produces twodimensional images that
seem to be threedimensional.

\fIbase\fP is the file describung the \*(rqrelief\*(lq of the 3d
model. It is a simple graphic where the brightness of a pixel defines
its individual depth.  The darker a pixel is, the more far away it
will seem to be in the final stereogram - the brighter it is, the
closer it will be.
.P
The \fItexture\fP is that what everyone sees when regarding your stereogram
\- even if he cannot get in the third dimensions of the composition.
If you use the \fB-w\fP swich this becomes optional.
.P
The width of the texture stands for the maximum depth of any steregram
and it cannot be greater than the distance of a viewer's two eyes -
otherwise they won't be able to see anything in the stereogram but the
beautiful great texture. As a hand rule, 100 should work nice for
stereograms of 640*480 up to 800*600 pixels. Use 110 to 120 for
greater ones.
.P
The files given as \fIbase\fP and \fItexture\fP must be supplied
either in the tga or in the png format. Which you used is derived from
the file name.
.P
\fIoutput\fP is the file where the stereogram is written to. The file
format to use is deduced from the filename given if not overridden by
\fB-f\fP. (\*rq.tga\*(lq, (\*rq.png\*(lq, and (\*rq.ppm\*(lq are
supported. If not given, \fBstereograph\fP will write the image in PPM
or the format given with \fB-f\fP format to the standard output.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP "\fB-v\fP"
Be verbose.

.IP "\fB-f\fP \fIoutputformat\fP"
\fIoutputformat\fP is one of the following: tga, png, or ppm.

.IP "\fB-A\fP"
The Aid flag \fB-A\fP will add a pair of black triangles at the top of
the stereogram to make it easier for unexperienced eyes to achieve the
magic view.

.SS "Quality controling arguments"

.IP "\fB-a\fP \fIanti-aliasing\fP"
\fIanti-aliasing\fP describes a value between 1 and 32 (4 is the
default) that declares how many pixels shall be calculated by the
renderer virtually for ONE pixel.
.IP
You can calculate easily: physically you habe n depth levels, where n
is the width of the texture used for the stereogram. With the AA
feature you now have theoretically a*n levels.  This feature increases
_massively_ the color depth of the output file

.IP "\fB-z\fP \fIzoom\fP"
based on the same idea as AA and has the same effects but physically
increases the file size. Values range from 1 (default) up to 32.

.SS "perspective"

.IP "\fB-d\fP \fIdistance\fP"
\fIdistance\fP describes the distance of your eyes and the virtual
glass that is between you and your stereogram. Allowed are values from
0.0 up to 8.0 where 0.6 is the default.

.IP "\fB-e\fP \fIeye\-shift\fP"
\fIeye\-shift\fP (a value between -1.0 and 1.0) controls the
perspective along the x axis (left to right). That is if e is positive
the image is shifted slightly to the right. The default value of 0.0
is exactly the centered perspective.


.SS layout

.IP "\fB-x\fP \fItexture\-insert\-x\fP"
\fItexture\-insert\-x\fP is a value between 0 and the width of the
\fItexture\fP controlling where the \fItexture\fP is inserted the
first time and where the rendering process begins its round. default:
0 (left image border).

.IP "\fB-y\fP \fItexture\-insert\-y\fP"
\fItexture\-insert\-y\fP is a value between 0 and the height of the
\fItexture\fP controlling where the \fItexture\fP is inserted the
first time and where the rendering process begins its round. default:
0 (top image border).

.IP "\fB-w\fP \fItexture\-width\fP"
\fItexture\-width\fP specifies the texture width to use for the
stereogram.  This option tells stereograph to generate a random
texture or if a texture was defined it resizes the texture to match
your dimension. Note that this can only reduce the width and
stereograph doesn't care about image ratios. It just cuts your
texture. Random textures cannot be used with transparent rendering.

.IP "\fB-M\fP, \fB-G\fP, \fB-C\fP, \fB-S\fP"
Use one of there flags to define which color type the random texture
should conform to. Use \fB-M\fP for monochrome, \fB-G\fP for a
grayscale or \fB-C\fP for a random color texture. Please note that the
random texture feature cannot be combined with transparent rendering
and that anti-aliasing increases the color depth of you image \- even
if you use a monochrome texture. To disable anti\-aliasing use \fB-a
1\fP.
.IP
The \fB-S\fP flag is experimental \- it generates an artistic random
texture.

.SS "base options"

.IP "\fB-I\fP"
inverts a base (non-transparent rendering only)

.IP "\fB-l\fP (\fBnone\fP|\fBback\fP|\fBtop\fP)"
adjusts the base levels for transparent rendering: the keyword
\fBnone\fP keeps the defined height levels of the base images,
\fBback\fP adjusts the bottom area of all upper layers to the level
defined by the preceding layer and \fBtop\fP adjusts the areas of
upper layers that are not as far as the preceeding layer to the level
of the preceding layer.

.IP "\fB-L\fP"
disables linear rendering.

.IP "\fB-R\fP"
The anti-artefacts feature tells \fBstereograph\fP to process every
second line in reversed order to prevent artefacts. This flag should
be used only with random textures.

.SS "transparancy"
.IP "\fB-T\fP \fIn\fP"
enables transparent stereograms where \fIn\fP is the number of
transparent layers. You must provide stereograph with \fIn\fP+1 bases
and \fIn\fP+1 textures. This option must PRECEED any other options!
.IP
Transparent stereograms are rendered in the same way as normal
stereograms, the only difference for you is to define more than one
input base file and provide respectively the same number of
textures. The different bases must have the same dimensions, the
textures must equal themselves in the width.
