  2000-06-02  * added the -w argument to define a

                for transparent stereograms and free

              * fixed triangle zoom
              * release 0.24

  2000-05-31  * added the -A flag (aid) which will
                add a pair of black triangles to the image
                to help the magic view of a stereogram;
              * release 0.23

  2000-05-21  * introduced transparent rendering,
                standard rendering remains untouched;
	      * in contrast to the single layer convention
                for transparency the renderer does NOT
                provide the application with internal gfx
                pointers. that's due to the issue that
                this great amount of memory shall not be
                cleared up with clear_renderer;

              * 0.14

  2000-03-31  * changed renderer memory management to speed
                up aa and zoom rendering
